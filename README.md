# PhotoComparator

This basis of this app is to make beautiful photo collages with pictures uploaded by the user. 
A user can upload their photos, to either Apples Cloud (CloudKit) or the local phone storage. 
Once the user has their photos uploaded, the user selects a template and creates a photo collage 
using 2-4 photos that displays them all in an orderly fashion. 

The end goal is eventually going to have a hub where users can upload and vote on who has the best
collages.
